In which we can see at the top right the **username** of who has logged in and his **role** ( in our case: **Administrator** ), and the three dots through which we can **logout**

In the **User Menu** we will find the following page, which shows us the **search filters** at the top, and the **list** of all the Users at the bottom

Inside the search filters there is a field called **Competence Name**, which shows us the values of the **Dimension Vet Authority** table for which we can search, it has two types of authorities, one of type **Region** and one of type **Office**
