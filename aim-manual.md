Pressing on **Sign in**, we return to the welcome page of our application

In which we can see at the top right the **username** of who has logged in and his **role** ( in our case: **Administrator** ), and the three dots through which we can **logout**

At the click of the **Logout** button we return to the previous page again, asking for confirmation of the operation

Pressing the button, the Logout confirmation page will appear

Instead, if we look to the left, we will find a **Sidebar**, having different menu items, which we will now show:

In the **User Menu** we will find the following page, which shows us the **search filters** at the top, and the **list** of all the Users at the bottom

Inside the search filters there is a field called **Competence Name**, which shows us the values of the **Dimension Vet Authority** table for which we can search, it has two types of authorities, one of type **Region** and one of type **Office**

For each user shown in the list below, we have various possible **Operations** to do

![image-10.png](./image-10.png)

We can **Disable** Users by pressing the Disable button, and if the operation was successful, a green **alert** will be shown ( as in this case ), otherwise red

By pressing the **Edit** button on the left instead, a **Modal** will open, which will allow us to modify some values of that user

![image-12.png](./image-12.png)

Pressing at the end, the **Roles** button, a **Modal** will open that shows us **all the values** of that user and shows us a **list of all the roles** attributed to him. We can also decide to Delete the role of a user, through the appropriate button

This Modal show ad also **Dropdown** that gives us the possibility to give him a **Role** (which will be inserted only if he does not already have it)

![image-14.png](./image-14.png)

In the **Activity Menu** we will find the following page, which shows us the **search filters** at the top, and the **list** of all the Activities at the bottom

![image-15.png](./image-15.png)

Exactly as for the User menu, the filter here allows us to search more effectively, through the two fields that we can see in the following image, and with the **Reset** button that allows us to delete all the filters inserted

Compared to before, however, here we have a **New** button that allows us to insert a New Activity, upon clicking this button, a **Modal** will open in which we should enter the values of the Activity
